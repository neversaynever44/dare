            Not many people would know or realise this about me, as everyone always says I’m so chatty and
            <b>confident</b> but I’ve suffered from anxiety for years.
          </p>
          <p class="hero__text">
            I’ve always been “a worrier” and most of the time I’ve found ways to manage it or hold it back for a few months. Unfortunately
            in this past year it has come back with a vengeance.
          </p>
          <h3 class="hero__title">
            I’ve spent whole nights wide awake having almost
            <span>constant panic attacks, shaking and crying.</span>
          </h3>
          <p class="hero__text">
            I don’t know why and I’ve spent hours and hours trying to work out why. I developed a horrendous fear of being left
            <b>on my own</b> at nighttime with my baby daughter. My husband works shifts and is often not home at night. It
            has been totally crippling and at times I’ve been terrified of my own mind. I’ve spent whole nights
            <b>wide awake</b> having almost constant panic attacks, shaking and crying. I felt sick to my stomach, I felt so
            terrified and anxious that I couldn’t even lie down in bed and close my eyes.
          </p>
          <p class="hero__text">
            I’ve put myself and my family to hell and back. My husband and my parents have been so worried about me, and despite their
            <b>unconditional support</b> I just couldn’t seem to pull myself out of it. I felt like I was letting everyone down.
            I went to see my doctor who prescribed me some tablets to take when I needed something to help me calm down.
            I felt totally disheartened that it had come to this. I don’t judge anyone who takes medication to help their
            mental health issues but I personally did not want to take this route when
            <b>I knew all my anxiety was created by my own mind.</b>
          </p>
          <p class="hero__text">
            One day I was desperately searching amazon and buying any anxiety book I thought might help when I came across Barry’s
            <span>DARE book</span>. I’ve spent years trying to relax, and breathe, and imagine myself lying on a beach, thinking
            of puppies, listening to relaxation music, absolutely anything to try and forget my anxiety and stay calm so
            this
            <span>DARE approach</span> was a totally new concept for me and actually at first it didn’t click.

            I laughed when I read about the idea of running towards my anxiety but at the same time the technique intrigued me and I
            was inspired by the fact that Barry himself had suffered from anxiety. Turns out that the step I thought was
            the silliest turned out to be the one that worked for me.
            <b>I stuck with it;</b> reading, practicing (especially when I wasn’t feeling anxious) and suddenly something clicked.
            <b>I’m no longer scared of anxiety,</b> I don’t fear it, I’m not running away, in fact I’m running towards it and
            embracing it.
          </p>
          <p class="hero__text">
            It sounds crazy but it really works! I feel free from the pressure of trying to imagine that I’m not experiencing anxiety.
            If it’s there, it’s there and
            <b>I’M NOT SCARED!</b> I say bring it on!!
          </p>
          <p class="hero__text">
            I wouldn’t say I’m anxiety free and I wouldn’t say I’m completely recovered but I’ve taken a
            <b>MASSIVE</b> step in the right direction. It doesn’t come easy and it takes hard work but suffering from anxiety
            is hard work anyway! You just have to decide which hard to choose!
          </p>
          <p class="hero__text">
            I have now realised that most of my anxiety came simply from fearing a panic attack. Fearing those horrible physical feelings.
            Barry’s
            <stroke>Ride the Wave</stroke> audio has really helped me to get my head around this and I love challenging my anxiety
            to do its worst in 21 seconds. It never accepts the challenge!

          </h3>
          <p class="hero__text">
            I can confidently say that anxiety won’t be ruling my life anymore. I have recently been back to see my doctor and I took
            the DARE book with me to show him. He was genuinely interested and made a note of the title. He said he will
            definitely be ‘prescribing’ it to his other patients. I hope that he does because everyone should be free of
            this!

                  I do have anxiety since I was 10 years, I feel always scared of dark, staying alone, suffering almost 20 years I was totally
                  dishearten, I always pray to god “oh god please help me out of this feelings” really if you pray from your
                  heart you will find the solution so I found the video of Barry who is also suffering from anxiety and the
                  symtoms is same as I have , I saw in one video that Barry advice when the panic attack comes to you just
                  accept and embrace it, really it works now I’m recovering day by day, I would like to thank you my god
                  who always guiding me and my second god is Barry, who save my life… Mr Barry god gives more blessing, wealth
                  and prosperity… Thank you everyone who is sharing such an inspiration video and hero.
